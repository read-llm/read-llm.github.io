    "message": "It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the provided task description. The task description mentions robots Alice and Bob, but the prompt is asking for actions for agents named 'Chad' and 'Dave'. Since there is no information about Chad and Dave in the task description or the environment state, I will proceed with the assumption that 'Chad' and 'Dave' are actually 'Alice' and 'Bob' respectively, and provide actions for them.\n\nGiven the current environment state, the closest cube to both Alice (Chad) and Bob (Dave) that they need to sweep is yellow_cube_1. Alice is 0.49 units away from it, and Bob is 1.15 units away from it. They should both move towards yellow_cube_1 to prepare for sweeping it into the dustpan.\n\nLet's proceed with the actions for Alice and Bob:\n\nEXECUTE\nNAME Alice ACTION MOVE yellow_cube_1\nNAME Bob ACTION MOVE yellow_cube_1"
