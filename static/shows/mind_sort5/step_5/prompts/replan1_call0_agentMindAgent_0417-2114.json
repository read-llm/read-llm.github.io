They form a straight assembly line, panel1 is closed to panel2 and farthest from panel7.\nThere are 3 cubes, each robot must place their cube on the correct target, their (cube, target_panel) pairs: \nAlice: (blue_square, panel2), \nBob: (pink_polygon, panel4), \nChad: (yellow_trapezoid, panel6).\nThere are 3 robots, each with a limited reach range, this means they can only pick cubes from these panels, and can only place cubes on these panels. The (robot, [reachable_panels]) pairs: \n(Alice, [panel1, panel2, panel3])\n(Bob, [panel3, panel4, panel5])\n(Chad, [panel5, panel6, panel7])\n\nRobot Alice, Bob and Chad need collaborate to put all cube to correct target panel as quickly as possible.\nPlease output the actions most suitable for robots to complete this task.\nImprove your plans if given [Environment Feedback].\nRespond very concisely but informatively.\nPropose exactly one action per robot at the **current** round, select from [Action Options].\nEnd your response must strictly follow [Action Output Instruction]!\n        \n[History]\n== Round#1 ==\n[Env state]: \nblue_square is on panel7\npink_polygon is on panel3\nyellow_trapezoid is on panel1\n[Agent state]: \nAlice's gripper is empty, can reach cubes: pink_polygon, yellow_trapezoid, can't reach cubes: blue_square, \nBob's gripper is empty, can reach cubes: pink_polygon, can't reach cubes: blue_square, yellow_trapezoid, \nChad's gripper is empty, can reach cubes: blue_square, can't reach cubes: pink_polygon, yellow_trapezoid,.\n[Response]: \nEXECUTE\nNAME Alice ACTION PICK yellow_trapezoid PLACE panel2\nNAME Bob ACTION PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel4\nNAME Chad ACTION PICK blue_square PLACE panel6\n[Feedback]: \n[Environment Feedback]:\n- Previous Plan:\nNAME Alice ACTION PICK yellow_trapezoid PLACE panel2\nNAME Bob ACTION PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel4\nNAME Chad ACTION PICK blue_square PLACE panel6\nTask Constraints:\n faild, Alice's ACTION is not valid, yellow_trapezoid cube can only be placed on panel6, panel3, panel5, but not on panel2Chad's ACTION is not valid, blue_square cube can only be placed on panel2, panel3, panel5, but not on panel6\n\n== Round#2 ==\n[Env state]: \nblue_square is on panel7\npink_polygon is on panel3\nyellow_trapezoid is on panel1\n[Agent state]: \nAlice's gripper is empty, can reach cubes: pink_polygon, yellow_trapezoid, can't reach cubes: blue_square, \nBob's gripper is empty, can reach cubes: pink_polygon, can't reach cubes: blue_square, yellow_trapezoid, \nChad's gripper is empty, can reach cubes: blue_square, can't reach cubes: pink_polygon, yellow_trapezoid,.\n[Response]: \nEXECUTE\nNAME Alice ACTION PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel2\nNAME Bob ACTION WAIT\nNAME Chad ACTION PICK blue_square PLACE panel5\n[Feedback]: \n[Environment Feedback]:\n- Previous Plan:\nNAME Alice ACTION PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel2\nNAME Bob ACTION WAIT\nNAME Chad ACTION PICK blue_square PLACE panel5\nTask Constraints:\n faild, Alice's ACTION is not valid, pink_polygon cube can only be placed on panel4, panel3, panel5, but not on panel2\n\n== Round#3 ==\n[Env state]: \nblue_square is on panel7\npink_polygon is on panel3\nyellow_trapezoid is on panel1\n[Agent state]: \nAlice's gripper is empty, can reach cubes: pink_polygon, yellow_trapezoid, can't reach cubes: blue_square, \nBob's gripper is empty, can reach cubes: pink_polygon, can't reach cubes: blue_square, yellow_trapezoid, \nChad's gripper is empty, can reach cubes: blue_square, can't reach cubes: pink_polygon, yellow_trapezoid,.\n[Response]: \nEXECUTE\nNAME Alice ACTION PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel3\nNAME Bob ACTION WAIT\nNAME Chad ACTION PICK blue_square PLACE panel5\n[Feedback]: \nNone\n== Round#4 ==\n[Env state]: \nblue_square is on panel5\npink_polygon is on panel3\nyellow_trapezoid is on panel1\n[Agent state]: \nAlice's gripper is empty, can reach cubes: pink_polygon, yellow_trapezoid, can't reach cubes: blue_square, \nBob's gripper is empty, can reach cubes: blue_square, pink_polygon, can't reach cubes: yellow_trapezoid, \nChad's gripper is empty, can reach cubes: blue_square, can't reach cubes: pink_polygon, yellow_trapezoid,.\n[Response]: \nEXECUTE\nNAME Alice ACTION PICK yellow_trapezoid PLACE panel3\nNAME Bob ACTION PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel4\nNAME Chad ACTION PICK blue_square PLACE panel2\n[Feedback]: \n[Environment Feedback]:\n- Previous Plan:\nNAME Alice ACTION PICK yellow_trapezoid PLACE panel3\nNAME Bob ACTION PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel4\nNAME Chad ACTION PICK blue_square PLACE panel2\n- Goal Step Alice (-0.28, 0.60, 0.50);
