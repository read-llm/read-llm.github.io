The closest yellow cube to me is indeed yellow_cube_1 at a distance of 0.49, not yellow_cube_2. Let's stick to the original plan and both MOVE to yellow_cube_1. I'll wait for your confirmation.\n\nPROCEED\n[Bob]:\nAlice, I apologize for the confusion. I have re-evaluated the distances, and you are correct.
