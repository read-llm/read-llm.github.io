However, yellow_cube_1 is not the closest cube that we need to sweep. The closest one is yellow_cube_2 at a distance of 0.48 from my current position. Let's both MOVE to yellow_cube_2 instead. I'll take the side opposite to your approach.\n\nPROCEED\n[Alice]:\nBob, I've double-checked the distances, and it seems there's a slight misunderstanding. The closest yellow cube to me is indeed yellow_cube_1 at a distance of 0.49, not yellow_cube_2. Let's stick to the original plan and both MOVE to yellow_cube_1. I'll wait for your confirmation.\n\nPROCEED\n[Bob]:\nAlice, I apologize for the confusion. I have re-evaluated the distances, and you are correct. Yellow_cube_1 is indeed the closest yellow cube to us. Let's proceed with the original plan and both MOVE to yellow_cube_1.

I suggest we MOVE to green_cube_3, which is at a distance of 0.43 from my current position. Please confirm if that's also the closest to you, or suggest an alternative.\n\nPROCEED\n[Bob]:\nAlice, I concur that we should continue with the yellow and green cubes. However, green_cube_3 is not the closest to me. The closest green cube to my current position is green_cube_1, which is at a distance of 1.24. I suggest we both MOVE to green_cube_1. Please confirm if this works for you.\n\nPROCEED\n[Alice]:\nBob, I agree that we should MOVE to green_cube_1 as it is the closest green cube to you. It is also within a reasonable distance from me.
