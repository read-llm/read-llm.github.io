Dave should WAIT because only one robot can PUT at a time and I need to place the tomato2 on the bread_slice1 which is not yet on the cutting_board.\n\nPROCEED\n[Dave]:\nChad, you should PICK bread_slice1 instead, as it is the first item in the recipe and needs to be PUT on the cutting_board before we can add any other ingredients. After you PICK and PUT bread_slice1, I can proceed with the next steps.\n\nPROCEED\n[Chad]:\nUnderstood, Dave. I will PICK bread_slice1 as it is indeed the first item that needs to be placed on the cutting_board. Once I have done that, you can continue with the next steps.\n\nEXECUTE\nNAME Chad ACTION PICK bread_slice1\nNAME Dave ACTION WAIT\n[Chad]:\nIt seems there was a misunderstanding. I cannot reach bread_slice1 as it is not on my side of the table.
