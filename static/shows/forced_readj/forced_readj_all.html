                    step-by-step about your plan and output your idea, and then
                    output 'EXECUTE<br>', then give exactly one action per
                    agent, put each on a new line.<br>Example#1: Since agent1 is
                    holding the plate facing the cooking station, the soup is
                    already cooked, agent1 should use the interact action to
                    serve the soup, and agent0 should grab the top onion.<br>EXECUTE<br>NAME
                    Agent0 ACTION north<br>NAME Agent1 ACTION interact<br>Example#2:
                    The soup is not ready yet and agent1 has the plate in his
                    hand, so agent1 is not moving at this turn and agent0 should
                    go to the nearest place to get the onion.<br>EXECUTE<br>NAME

                    Information]<br>This is overcooked environment. Two agents
                    need to collaborate to cook soup and deliver the cooked soup
                    to the service desk to earn a reward. <br>Each soup needs 2
                    onions, pick up 2 onions and put them into the cooking table
                    for cooking, <br>when the cooking table shows the number of
                    2, the soup is finished, and you need to take a plate of
                    soup and deliver <br>it to the service desk, which can get a
                    bowl of soup reward, you need to think and give the actions
                    of two agents, to ensure that <br>after 30 interactions can
                    get a high enough reward.<br>[Layout Information]<br>The
                    size of the room is a 5 × 5 grid, and the overall layout is:<pre>

                                                                    </pre>[Character meaning]<br>The
                    letter X stands for table, P for cooking station, O and o
                    stand for onion, D and d for plates, and S for service desk.
                    <br>When the onion or dish is on the table or being held by
                    agent, an o or d will be added after its corresponding
                    character.<br>When the onion is placed on the cooking table,
                    it will be denoted as p{ø, p{øø means that there are two
                    onions on the cooking table.<br>And when the cooking table
                    cooks the soup, it will show how long it has been cooked,
                    such as p{ø20 means that it has been cooked in 20 time
                    steps. <br>The numbers 1 and 0 represent the agent, and the
                    direction arrow ↑ ↓ ← → represents the direction the agent
                    is facing.Each object occupies a grid size, and the agent
